            This was our third visit to the hotel and decided to Book a two
            night stay with breakfast for myself and my partner and it was
            fantastic!! we arrived late due to work but the staff at the
            reception was more than welcoming, our room was excellent with a
            great view of the castle and river, it was very clean and decor was
            fitting for the style of hotel and surroundings. Room service was
            again excellent with polite and smart staff, breakfast loads of
            choice and cooked well, Staff always friendly and polite and more
            than happy to go out there way to help you especially as my partner
            is vegan so food can be tricky in some places.

            Ok, here we go! I would say this was one of best hotels I have tried
            so far. I checked out the gym, pool, breakfast, and of course the
            room itself. I liked the gym, it‚Äôs not that big but tidy and clean!
            If you like yoga, don‚Äôt be shy and go to the pool outside and do it
            next to the pool, I enjoyed it so deeply. The room is quite nice,
            big and cozy. The only thing I don‚Äôt like was the cleaning, it was
            not that clean as I would expect for this kind of the hotel. As
            usual, I keep forgetting my toothbrush, guys from reception answered
            the call in the middle of night, and brought it to my room. I loved
            the breakfast itself Thank u üôèüèº
